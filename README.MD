# Lets collect ALL the assaultcube maps ever created!
I have tried to setup a structure in which makes it easy to find what maps you are looking for. (ac version > game mode > etc)

## How To Contribute:
idk yet, ill get everyone permissions soon.
For now I think you have to push and create a pull request and I have to accept. There may be a way to automate this and make it easier.

## How To Download and use the maps:
1. Download the maps you want for your version of A.C.
    - You can click the individual map and click downlaod.
    - You can download the whole repository as a zip.
    - You can clone the repository using git. Look up a tutorial on using git with github(I use git Bash)
2. Place the files into your AssaultCube maps directory.
    #### FOR WINDOWS:
      > C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\AssaultCube_v1.2\packages\maps
